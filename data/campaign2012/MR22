"This is a tough time, and so the President put an ad out yesterday talking about gasoline prices and how high they are, and guess who he blamed? Me! Why, maybe after I'm president I can take responsibility for things I might have done wrong, but this president doesn't want to take responsibility for his mistakes. I mean talk about someone who is running as far away from Harry Truman's dictum as possible. Harry Truman had the sign on his desk that said ‘The Buck Stops Here,' but this president is always looking for somewhere else to point." — Mitt Romney
