Senator John F.

But the fact that only one other Negro has been appointed as a lifetime Federal judge and that no Negro has been appointed a district judge show how far we still have to go in making our judiciary representative of the best of all our people. 

The lawyer's group included Elmer C. Jackson, of Kansas City, president of the National Bar Association; Edward B. Toles, of Chicago chairman of the Judiciary Committee; William S. Thompson, of Washington, D.C., executive board member; Theodore W. Coggs, of Milwaukee, second vice president; Leroy G. Charles, of Chicago, regional director; Roy C. Garvin, of Washington, D.C., and Mrs. Rosa Charles, of Chicago, president of the women's auxiliary of the National Bar Association. I assure you that in a new Democratic administration there will be far better representation, on the basis of merit, of persons of all our racial groups, including particularly those who in the past have been excluded on the basis of prejudice. For no American should be disqualified for an office because of his race, color, religion, or family origin. It is time for us to practice what our Constitution preaches. The Federal judiciary and the Federal service should be a model of Americanism, in which there are no traces of any form of arbitrary discrimination.
