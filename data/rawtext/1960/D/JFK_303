 Kennedy said. 

 

Senator John F. Kennedy today declared that-- Rising unemployment and slack business conditions will cause a loss of at least $2 billion in anticipated revenue--The $2-billion loss of budgeted revenue would have fully financed the Democratic program of Federal aid to education, the Democratic housing program, and the Democratic program for area redevelopment; a return to conditions of full employment will mean not only more jobs, but also greater revenue to the Government. 

By revising downward their estimate of revenues, the mid-year budget report has officially admitted the current state of stagnation in our economy. The time has come to elect an administration committed to a policy of full employment.
