 Senator Kennedy added: 

 

 

Senator John F. Kennedy today announced that a group of distinguished scientists and practitioners in the field of aging released a statement endorsing his approach to meeting the problems of the Nation's 16 million senior citizens. The prominent gerontologists signing the statement entitled it "A Positive Response to the Challenge of Aging." Senator Kennedy said: 

The aged of this Nation deserve to spend their retirement years with proper recognition and respect for the contributions they have made to the American economy. They should have an income adequate to permit them to continue their important contributions to American life and a program of medical insurance through the social security system for dignified health care. I am proud of the endorsement of these outstanding scientists and practitioners in the field of aging. 

I pledge to work with them in applying more rapidly the proven results of their research and experience. With good physical and mental health our senior citizens can derive meaning and joy from their golden years.
