 Senator Kennedy asserted. 

 Senator Kennedy spoke to a group of national leaders of civic and fraternal organizations meeting at his home in Hyannis Port. The group represented Americans of recent immigrant background of 21 national origins. 

 Kennedy declared in a special message to the Hellenic communities of America. 

 Gov. G. Mennen Williams (Michigan), chairman of the nationalities division of the Democratic National Committee, attended the meeting along with 38 chairmen of sections of the nationalities division from various States. Also attending the meeting were Representatives Thaddeus Machrowicz (Michigan), Henry S. Reuss (Wisconsin), and Mayor E. F. Voorde (Indiana), nationalities division members. 

Senator John F. Kennedy today pledged that "high priority" would be given by a Democratic administration to the platform plank calling for amendments to the immigration and naturalization laws to ban discrimination based on national Origin. I am honored and delighted to count among my closest friends many Americans of Hellenic descent. 

Senator Kennedy continued: It was the ancient Greeks who first invented and practiced democracy in the unequaled Athens of Pericles. Their descendants are serving America with distinction and great credit in the arena of politics and governmental service whenever opportunity to do so is given to them.

Among the delegates conferring with Senator Kennedy today was Gregory G. Lagakos, of Philadelphia, American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association (AHEPA).
