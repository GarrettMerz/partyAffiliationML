 Live from West Chester University outside Philadelphia, the "HARDBALL College Tour," with our special guest, Senator Barack Obama!

(APPLAUSE AND CHEERS)

 All right!

: Wow!

: How about that!

: Wow!

: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

: One of the perks, Senator, of being president of the United States is that you have your own bowling alley.

(LAUGHTER)

: Are you ready to bowl from day one?

: Obviously, I am not.

(LAUGHTER)

: Ha!

: But I figure there might be some bowlers here at West Chester.

(APPLAUSE AND CHEERS)

: I just want to thank all of them for hosting us, Dr. Adler and all the students, soâ€“this is a wonderful group. Thank you so much for having me.

: I know you're a pretty good b-ball player.

: Basketball I can play.

: OK. Let me give you some good news. This is good news.

I'm going to announce it here. An endorsement from you from the Philadelphia area, an important endorsement. Forget issues like who's ready from day one or who do you want answering a 3:00 AM phone call in the White House or the ramifications of NAFTA. To us, the most important issue is very simple and one that no one is talking about in the battle for the Democratic nomination for president. Who's the biggest jock? And it is based on the answer to that, obviously, earth-shattering question that we proudly endorse Barack Obama for president, "Philly Sport" magazine.

: That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about.

(APPLAUSE AND CHEERS)

: That's what I'm talking about.

: And now we play HARDBALL.

: Fire away.
