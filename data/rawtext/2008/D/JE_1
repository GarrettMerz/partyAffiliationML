 Senator Edwards, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.

 Thank you for having me, Tim.

 A few weeks ago, Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts was on this program, and he said that, in his entire career in the United States Senate, spanning 40 years, the vote he cast on the war in–on–in Iraq was the most important. Do agree with it was the most important vote you cast?

 Yes.

 And, in your mind, you got it wrong.

 I did.

 I'm going to go back to October of 2002, that critical week when the Senate was debating the war and you gave a speech to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

 Yes, sir.

 Let's watch it and come back and talk about it.
