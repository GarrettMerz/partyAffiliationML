You know, the other day the President, I guess it was just yesterday, he was in Ohio and he said that this campaign is going to come down to his vision, his vision for America. If you want to know where his vision leads, open your eyes because we've been living it for the last three years. It leads to lost jobs, lost homes, lost dreams. It's time to end that vision and have a vision of growth and jobs and economic vitality." â€” Mitt Romney
